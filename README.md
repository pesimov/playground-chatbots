# playground-chatbots
A prototype, playground-type repository for chatbots. 


After I saw someone use a chatbot to turn on and off a ligthbulb, I wanted to look into this new area. 

So far (September 20th, 2017): 
I saw someone use a MS Azure Chatbot for Home Automation to control a light bulb
Read through two sources of information on chatbots:

Siraj Raval's videos on Youtube, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A

My idea of a prototype for myself is to have: 
A Siri chatbot playing specific music
An Azure Chatbot; possibly used in home automation with Raspberry Pi 3.
